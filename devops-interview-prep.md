# DevOps Interview Preparation Kit

---

## 1. **Version Control (Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)**

**Key Concepts:**
- Branching & Merging
- Conflict Resolution
- Git Workflows (Git Flow, GitHub Flow)
- Pull Requests and Code Reviews

**Sample Interview Q&A:**
- *Q: What is Git?*
  - **A:** Git is a distributed version control system that lets multiple developers work on a project simultaneously, tracking changes and enabling collaboration.

- *Q: How do you resolve a merge conflict in Git?*
  - **A:** Use `git status` to identify conflicting files, manually edit them to fix conflicts, then add and commit the changes.

- *Q: What is a rebase and when would you use it?*
  - **A:** A rebase applies your changes on top of another branch, creating a linear history. Use it to integrate updates before merging or to clean up commit history.

- *Q: How do you squash commits in Git?*
  - **A:** Use `git rebase -i <base-commit>` and mark commits as "squash" to combine them, then save and complete the rebase.

- *Q: What is a fork and how is it different from a branch?*
  - **A:** A fork creates a separate copy of a repository, usually for contributing to open source; a branch is a pointer within the same repo.

  - **A:** You can trigger rollback by redeploying a previous stable artifact or using deployment strategies like blue-green or canary to revert traffic.

- *Q: How do you handle secret management in your pipelines?*
  - **A:** Use secret management tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and pipeline features to inject secrets securely, avoiding hardcoding.

- *Q: What is blue-green deployment? What is canary deployment?*
  - **A:** Blue-green deployment uses two environments to switch traffic from old to new with minimal downtime. Canary deployment gradually shifts traffic to the new version, monitoring for issues.

## 15. **Scenario-Based Interview Questions & Answers**

#### Incident Handling
- **Q:** Describe a time when a deployment failed in production. How did you handle it?
  - **A:** When a deployment failed due to a misconfigured environment variable, I immediately checked the deployment logs and rolled back to the previous stable release using our CI/CD pipeline. I coordinated with the team to fix the configuration, redeployed, and monitored the system health. Afterward, we added automated checks for environment variables to prevent similar issues.

#### Automating Manual Tasks
- **Q:** Give an example of how you automated a manual process.
  - **A:** We used to manually provision and configure servers for new environments. I automated this using Terraform and Ansible, creating reusable templates and playbooks. This reduced setup time from hours to minutes and eliminated configuration drift.

#### Handling High CPU Usage
- **Q:** A production server is experiencing high CPU usage. What steps would you take?
  - **A:** I would first use monitoring tools and commands like `top` or `htop` to identify the process causing the spike. Iâ€™d check logs and recent changes, then determine if itâ€™s due to a code deployment or external factors. If necessary, Iâ€™d scale resources, restart affected services, and coordinate with developers for a fix.

#### Security Breach
- **Q:** How would you respond to a security breach detected in one of your containers?
  - **A:** Iâ€™d isolate the affected container, analyze logs and network traffic, and determine the attack vector. Iâ€™d patch the vulnerability, scan other containers for similar issues, and update our images. Finally, Iâ€™d conduct a postmortem and improve security controls like image scanning and network segmentation.

#### Scaling Application
- **Q:** Your application is experiencing a sudden increase in traffic. How do you handle it?
  - **A:** Iâ€™d use auto-scaling features of our cloud provider or Kubernetes HPA to add more instances. Iâ€™d monitor system metrics and ensure the database and storage can handle the load. If necessary, Iâ€™d optimize caching and review resource limits.

#### Cloud Cost Optimization
- **Q:** How have you optimized cloud costs in your previous projects?
  - **A:** I implemented resource tagging and regular audits, rightsized instances based on usage, used reserved instances, and automated shutdown of non-critical resources after hours. I also used cost monitoring tools to proactively identify and eliminate waste.

#### Disaster Recovery
- **Q:** How do you ensure disaster recovery for critical services?
  - **A:** I set up automated backups, multi-region replication, and infrastructure as code for reproducibility. We conduct regular DR drills to validate our recovery procedures and update documentation accordingly.
